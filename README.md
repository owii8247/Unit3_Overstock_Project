# Unit3_Overstock_Project
We were a team of 6 from the Masai Web-17 batch who worked on cloning the Overstock website as part of our Unit-3 construct week. As a team, we were given a project to clone the Overstock website. Our project demonstrates a basic flow of an e-commerce page dealing basically with furniture, where a customer can view and filter products, add their product to a cart and place his or her happy order.
We are passionate about doing our part to make life better. We provide high-quality merchandise, great value, and exceptional customer service. We connect people with products and services in new and unexpected ways. We do our part to create dream homes for all.
